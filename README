LetMeKnow - Google Calendar notifications using Frozen.

Logs in to your Google Calendar via the API and shows you what's coming up.
Primary usage is with the 'await' subcommand, for example:

python letmeknow.py await --offset 300 --title

The code is currently bound to Python 2 due to limitations of the Google API
module, but should be easy enough to port to Py3 when that is lifted.
